# Learning traces from VR activities BB â€“ Design Document

The "VR Traces" component is designed to capture, record and analyse user interactions with virtual reality (VR) exercises in educational and training contexts. Using the xAPI standard for data structuring, this system enables in-depth analysis of learners' behaviour, successes and difficulties within VR simulations. Key components include the generation of xAPI traces, integration with Learning Record Stores (LRS) for data storage, and analysis tools to interpret the data.Traces are decided by simulator's editor.

## Context

This BB needs some keywords to understand it.

* **Sensor**: This is a value used for the definition of result. Indeed, a result is not only composed of an overall score but also more precise scoring such as the sensors.Defined by a key and a value, it is often taken into account in the overall score.
It is representing a competence evaluated during our exercise, such as for example the quality of execution or the safety of the work area, etc... 

* **Event**: This is an action that deserves to be recorded in the execution of the exercise.
Defined by the creator of the software, it allows you to see errors, users' failures or users success but also to report important events that occur in the exercise.

## Technical usage scenarios & Features

- xAPI Trace Generation: Automated creation of xAPI traces for every significant interaction within VR environments, providing a detailed record of learner activity.
- Integration with LRS: xAPI traces are sent to a compatible LRS, facilitating secure storage and retrieval of learning data for later analysis.

### Features/main functionalities

- Automated Interaction Capture: Real-time recording of every significant learner action in the VR environment, enabling complete traceability of learning experiences.
- Standardisation of Learning Data: Use of the xAPI standard to format captured data, ensuring interoperability and compatibility with a variety of LRS systems and analytical tools.

* Prioritisation of Events by Severity: Events captured are classified according to their severity (e.g. "success", "info", "warning", "error"), enabling educators to prioritise interventions or feedback according to the urgency or importance of situations encountered by learners.
* Performance details by sensor: specific scores for each evaluation criterion, such as safety (80%) and completion time (95%), providing a detailed view of the learner's strengths and areas for improvement.

## Integrations

_See "01_BB Connections" spreadsheet_

### Direct Integrations with Other BBs

### Integrations via Connector

**Integration with consent**

Why?

- User consent to send his traces

What?

- Obtain the user's consent to send his trace

- Obtain person's agreement to share data with selected organizations

**Integration with contract**

Why?

- A contract between the LRS (Learning Record Store) supplier and the user organisation is essential to ensure that learning data is managed in a compliant and secure manner. This makes it possible to :

- Guarantee compliance: ensure that data processing complies with regulatory standards and institutional agreements on privacy and data security.
  Define Access and Processing Rights: Clearly establish the rights and limits relating to access and processing of learning data collected through simulations.

What?

- Determining the Granularity of Authorised Learning Traces: The contract should specify the levels of detail of xAPI traces that can be collected and sent to the LRS. This includes the possibility for learners to choose which type of traces (e.g. info, warning, error) they are willing to share. This approach makes it possible to respect the learner's wish to keep certain information private, such as that relating to errors, while sharing other types of constructive or informative feedback.

- Obtain the Organisation's Agreement: Confirm the organisation's agreement to the export of user metadata to the LRS, ensuring that the organisation has fully consented to this data sharing.

**Integration with identity**

Why?

- Personalising the Learning Experience: Using user identities to personalise their learning journey, delivering a more engaging and effective experience by adapting content and feedback according to their performance and preferences.

What?

- Enable simulator to use users' identities to display metadata such as firstname, lastname, email

## Input / Output Data

The sample xAPI traces represent a sequence of events in a fibre welding simulation by John Doe, capturing key moments: the beginning, the most significant interactions (classified by severity), and the end. Here is a detailed explanation of each trace, highlighting the exercise ID, the registration ID, and the object IDs to understand how these elements reconstruct Jean Dupont's learning scenario.

The first trace is the initialisation trace, which marks the start of the fibre welding exercise. It contains the following information:

![startSimulation](medias/startExerciseInSimulation.png)

*Start an exercise in simulator*

- Actor: Jean Dupont, the learner.
- Verb: "initialized", indicating the start of the exercise.
- Object: The exercise itself, identified by a unique URL which includes the exercise ID (b9e16535-4fc9-4c66-ac87-3ad7ce515f5c), named "fibre welding".
  - Context separation : The specific URL (https://navy.mil/netc/xapi/activities/simulations/) is used to uniquely identify activities taking place in a simulation context. This allows systems processing or analysing xAPI data to immediately understand that the interactions recorded did not occur in the real world, but in a simulated environment. By having a unique identifier for simulations, organisations can separate and manage data generated by simulations differently to data from other types of learning activities. This is particularly useful for analysing performance, evaluating skills acquired in simulation, and comparing with real learning activities. This highlights the importance of distinguishing virtual learning experiences from those carried out in real physical environments.
- Context:
  - Registration: Unique identifier (f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479) used as a correlation identifier to link all traces related to this specific exercise attempt by John Doe.
  - Parent: The course associated with this exercise, facilitating contextualisation within the learning application.
  - category element enables traces to be classified according to their technological context. This allows you to quickly identify the type of environment or technology used for the learning experience. Using categories such as "VR Exercise", "Mixed Reality Exercise", "Augmented Reality", etc. helps to distinguish between the different methodologies and technologies used in learning.
  - platform represent the simulator
  - extensions : sessionid is used to associate the interaction with a specific activity in a Learning Management System (LMS), such as Moodle. The value "moodle-activity-12345" uniquely identifies the activity within Moodle, enabling a direct correlation between learning data captured via xAPI and activities structured and managed via the LMS.

**registration** is a unique identifier assigned to a specific instance of a learning activity or session. This identifier is used to group together all the interactions and events linked to that particular session, enabling consistent and contextualised analysis of the learning data. It can be used to correlate all the actions, decisions and results of a learner within the same learning session.

Summary of this trace is as follows: John Doe(Actor) started (Verb) a fibre welding exercise on 15 March 2024 ( timestamp). This exercise is part of the "Course fibre welding" ( parent) course. The exercise takes place on the "Discover" simulator (platform), in a virtual reality environment (category). A unique identifier (registration) is generated for this exercise, marking the start of this session and also serving as an anchor point for all John's future interactions and assessments within this simulation (Object id).

At the heart of the fibre welding exercise undertaken by Jean Dupont, a series of xAPI traces captures every key moment, enriching our understanding of how the exercise unfolded. Each trace is classified by its nature on the learning experience.

*Multiple choice button to send event*

- Success: The traces of success illustrate good choices or actions, often in contradiction with the traces of errors.

- Error: Some tracks reveal moments of challenge or error, such as a non-straight cut, critical errors that require immediate attention.

- Info: There are captured moments that provide valuable information, such as event going in the simulation, affirming the right actions and reinforcing good practice.

- Warning: Other marks bear the word warning, such as a stripping that's too short, signalling areas of caution where Jean is invited to pay particular attention to avoid potential mistakes.

- Actor: John Doe, the learner.
- Verb: "interacted", indicating the interaction.
- Object: This is the specific address of the event in the fibre welding exercise, allowing it to be distinguished from other interactions or events. The ID comprises the exercise identifier (b9e16535-4fc9-4c66-ac87-3ad7ce515f5c) followed by a unique event identifier (0221144), providing contextual traceability of the interaction.
  The description provides a more detailed overview of the event, explaining the specific action or context of the interaction. Here, it reveals a specific mistake made by the learner: failing to use the fibre cutter to obtain a perfectly straight cut.
- Context:
  - Registration: Unique identifier (f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479) used as a correlation identifier to link all traces related to this specific exercise attempt by John Doe. Each of these traces, whether it signals an error, a warning, or provides information, is linked by the registration correlation identifier.
  - extensions : sessionid is used to associate the interaction with a specific activity in a Learning Management System (LMS), such as Moodle. The value "moodle-activity-12345" uniquely identifies the activity within Moodle, enabling a direct correlation between learning data captured via xAPI and activities structured and managed via the LMS.
- result
  - success : Informs whether the event was successful or not
  - extensions : Provides information on the type of event and offers granularity on the action taken. This can be warned for actions requiring attention but remains acceptable, error for actions requiring attention for reasons that invalidate the success of the exercise, the learner is not able to perform this action, Info to give additional information on the context, the action is validated.

## Dynamic Behaviour

![dynamic behavior](medias/dynamicBehavior.png)

## Test specification

This BB will provide a unity package which includes multiple Unity scenes.\
In these scenes, an interface will permit to run all the tests.

### Test plan

This BB will mostly work with Unity in runtime.\
You don't need to connect Unity with an LRS to test this package. All traces could be found in the console of Unity Editor.\
Test scene will be providing for "Internal unit tests" and "Component-level tests."

### Internal unit tests

Internal unit tests will be made by a script in a test scene to create, one full exercise traces with initialized, event-success, event-info, event-warning, event-error and result trace with predefine values.
Files with traces already done will be here to compare with results of the test to see regressions.

### Component-level testing

After a creation of a ScriptableObject in unity, to make your LRS configuration, run the provided test scene.
In Unity runtime mode, you will be able to fill the available fields (user informations and exercise informations) and create the three types of traces.

You'll be able to find your traces, in your connected LRS and in the Console of Unity Editor.
